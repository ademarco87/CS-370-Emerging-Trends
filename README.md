# CS-370-Emerging-Trends

**Pirate Treasure Hunt AI - CS-370 Project**
  For this project, I was provided with starter code that included the enviorment, which included GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py. The provided code handled the maze, movement rules and reward structure. Additionally, the original Jupyter file had a skeletal code and psuedocode to follow along in training an agent to autonomously complete the maze based on the movement reles and reward structures.

  The code I created (replacing the psuedocode) was to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm inside the qtrain() function. This involved writing the logic for exploration and exploitation and updating the neural network based on past iterations. I had also identified a bug in the provided code, where the wrong parameter was passed during the training. The Jupyter provided code parameter had n_epochs, where as the qtrain() called for n_epoch (IE, Not plural). I adjusted the qtrain() to accept both methods.

**Connecting Learning to the Field of Computer Science**
  Throughout this course, computer science is multi-faceted. Computer science is ultimately about designing efficient systems and solving real-world problems. A computer scientists is far more than just writing code- they create algorithms, solve and optimize problems, analyze data, design intelligent systems, improve technologies. The term computer science revolves around innovation across every technological industy.

  When approaching problems, I start small. I start with requirements and break it down into smaller segments for easier management. Attacking problems in smaller sections reduce having to look at the entire picture at first. Trying to solve a world size issue is nearly impossible at first. Combining smaller problems into a large solution is more easily managed.

  Ethically, I have a responsibility to both end user and the organization. Systems needs to be reliable, secure and promote fairness. While it seems easier said than done, I must attempt to avoid bias, protect users and their personal data, design systems that do not intentially harm users. Transparency and self accountability are the core traits that every developer should protray. Through works, continously learning and evolving the code, I am able to build a solid trust within the network of individuals.
